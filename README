PurpleHaze Chess engine

This project started during the winter of 2006/2007 as an excuse to learn with a real project how to write object oriented code in Java but the result was deadly slow. Then it stopped during almost two years while I learned about algorithms in chess engine by reading thirty years of (passioning) scientific papers on the subject.

The project started again from scratch during the summer of 2009 again as an excuse to learn properly a new language. This time it was C++ and the result was much better. It continued on and off until early 2010 when it become clear that it needed a major re-factoring.

The specifications of a new version is partially written but the present version is from a previous one with a lot of bugs and some features not properly working. Therefor it must be considered as a draft. I must add that some algorithms and most of its ideas come from the Computer Chess Club Forums (http://talkchess.com/forum/) and the Chess Programming Wiki (http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/).
